# mars_news_and_weather
In the first part of this assignment I scrapped data from the site "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html" and extracted
the titles and summarys for the "mars news".
For the second part, I scrapped data from the site "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html" to analyze
mars weather.
